<h1>HOW COLD WEATHER AFFECTS ENGINE OIL</h1>

<br><br>
<font size="4">Cold weather can wreak havoc on your vehicle in general, but did you know it can also affect your motor oil? Engine oil flows differently in cold temperatures, and that can lead to engine trouble.

<br><br>
<h2>HOW DOES COLD WEATHER AFFECT CAR ENGINES? </h2>
<br><br>
<font size="4">In the winter months, your engine may take longer to reach its optimal operating temperature. And when the weather is extremely cold, your motor oil's ability to flow properly may be delayed. When this happens, your engine might not run as efficiently when it's extremely cold out.

<h2>DOES MOTOR OIL FREEZE? </h2>
<font size="4">In extreme cold, yes, motor oil can freeze. If you haven't already, you may want to consider switching to synthetic oil for your next oil change. Synthetic oils often retain their viscosity levels and can better resist freezing, even in extreme cold. 
</font><br><br>
<h2>STAY AHEAD OF ENGINE PROBLEMS AND LOW OIL IN COLD WEATHER</h2>
<font size="5">1. TAKE LONGER TRIPS.</font><br><br>
<font size="5">2. AVOID EXTENDED IDLING.</font><br><br>
<font size="5">3. CONSIDER SWITCHING TO SYNTHETIC OIL.</font><br><br>
<font size="5">4. USE THE RIGHT OIL TYPE FOR YOUR CAR'S MILEAGE. </font><br><br>
<font size="5">5. HAVE YOUR OIL AND FILTER CHECKED.</font><br><br>
<font size="5">6. CHECK YOUR BATTERY. </font><br><br>
